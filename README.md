# CS-2420
The entire codebase for my CS 2420: Data Structures and Algorithms course at Dixie State University. In this course, we implemented several searching/sorting algorithms, and several data structures. The language used was python. Throughout all of the assignment folders, you'll see implementations of
1. Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shaker Sort
2. Merge Sort, Quick Sort, HashSort, 
3. PostFix expression evaluator and graphing calculator
4. Stack
4. Binary Search Tree
5. HashTable
6. Graph
7. BreadthFirst Search, DepthFirst Search
8. Dijkstra's Algorithmn
9. Priority Queue/Heap

I felt like this was the first actual Computer Science learning I had ever done, and enjoyed the course immensely. A major part of the course was searching through a database of student names (which lived in txt files), to get/edit information. As the course moved on, we saw the differences in complexity between the different algorithms and data structures. The majority of those txt files are not included in this repository because the file sizes are too large. We built the programs to recieve those files as inputs and to read them line by line for their data, which is what you'll see a majority of the assignments doing. Some of the smaller txt files remain, but most of the larger significant files aren't.
