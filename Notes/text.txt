1.What is the log based 2 of 130,000,000
2. what is log basee 4 of 1,000,000
3. Assume a cit password must be exactly 9 characters. The first 3 characters must be a lowercase letter. The next 3 may be lower case letters or upper case letters. The last 3 must be one of the ten digits. How many different password poassibilities are there? (Don't do the math- just write the formula)

4. What is big O analysis?
	Big o analysis is the study of how work increases as problem size increases.
5. When is big o analysis not important?
	when you deal with small data samples. 

7. List 5 big o categories, and an algorithm that fits into each. 
C pop to list
N Hashsort
Nlogn Merge Quick
N^2 Bubble, selection, shaker
n^3 Card shuffle the bad way
n! traveling salesman
2^n SAT
8. Show what happens to this array on one pass of the quicksort. Use the 4 on the far left as the pivot. and use the same algorithm we studied in class.
original array: 4 7 2 1 8 3 9 5

9. Fill out this table with correct big-o categories
				expected case  worse case   best case
Shaker sort     n^2				n^2			n
Quick sort		nlogn 			n^2			nlogn
mergesort 		nlogn 			nlogn		nlogn
hash			n 				n 			n
selection 		n^2 			n^2 		n^2
bubble 			n^2 			n^2 		n^2
10. If you are trying to speed up code that is running slowly, where is the bottle neck code likely to be?
	Where the worst big o is. 
11. What happens to overall speed of excution if you make all the code that is not the bottlenekc code go 1000 times faster?
	Doesn't change the speed of the code that much.
12. Why is it more likely that Factoring might be solved in polynomial time that SAT?
	Because it hasn't been proven NP complete.

15. Convert this infix expression to postifx: 2*(3+4/5*6)/(9-4+3/2)*8
16 Evaluate this postfix expression: 123*+4-6*82

17. Write python code that finds a prints the average age of all students in the python list names "allstudents". Assum "allstudents" is ready to go. 
	Don't use traverse method, but loop through the list ourselves.
18. Write python code for the IsEmpty method of your stack class.
(will not be asked to reproduce infixtopostfix. Won't ask to reproduce evaluate postfix. Won't ask to reproduce quicksort entirely. Won't ask to reproduce mergesort in entirety)

linked lists are going to be on the tests.
